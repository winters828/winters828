- ğŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Samuel Winter but Sam works just fine.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in whatever will help me gain experience in the world of programming currently I'm doing that through Wiley Edge and am grateful for the opportunity.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything I get introduced to that will help me in the future but my main focus during my training course is Maven Java projects with the Spring framework.
